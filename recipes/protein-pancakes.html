    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These gluten-free protein pancakes made with coconut flour, bananas, and chocolate chips are easy to make and will disappear quickly from your breakfast table on Sunday mornings.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup coconut flour</li>
        <li>1 scoop gluten-free protein powder (such as GNC Pro Performance® Isolate)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup 2% milk, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened coconut flakes</li>
        <li>¼ cup miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 large banana</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine coconut flour and protein powder in a bowl. Whisk in eggs. Add milk, 1/4 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly until incorporated; batter should not be too thick or too runny. Sprinkle coconut flakes and chocolate chips into batter; mix well.</li>
        <li>Grease a large skillet with olive oil spray and place over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cut banana into 24 slices. Place all slices into the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip banana slices, add a drop of honey onto each one, and cook until caramelized, about 3 more minutes. Transfer banana slices to a plate.</li>
        <li>Using 1/2 of the pancake batter, spoon four equal circles into the skillet. Press 3 banana slices into each circle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat to make remaining pancakes.</li>
    </ol>
